# üêç BasicProgramming

This folder provides a self-contained, beginner-friendly introduction to the essential Python libraries needed for scientific computing and time series analysis. The notebooks and their solutions are designed to support the Wigner Summer Camp curriculum, building foundational skills before moving on to more advanced topics like the ALT method for time series classification.

## üìö Contents

During the processing ot these documents, we are suggesting the use of our [basic-programming.pdf](**Basic Programming for AI**) presentation which covers the mentioned topics and provides a foundation for working with these notebooks listed below. For reaching the source file of the presentation, [basic-programming.tex](click here).

## üìÇ Datasets

- [data.csv](data.csv)
- [data.tsv](data.tsv)

## üöÄ How to Use

1. Open the `.ipynb` files in Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebook, or VS Code.
2. Follow along the explanations and complete the exercises.
3. Check your work using the corresponding `_solutions.ipynb` files.

These materials are ideal for those who are new to scientific programming and aim to gain practical experience with the tools used throughout the camp and modern computational research in general.
