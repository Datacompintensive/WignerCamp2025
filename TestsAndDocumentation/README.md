# TestAndDocumentation

This folder introduces the basics of writing and testing Python functions using `pytest`, as well as documenting them using NumPy-style docstrings.

## ðŸ“š Contents

- [`Documentation.md`](./Documentation.md): Explains how to write **NumPy-style docstrings** for documenting Python functions. Useful for scientific and technical code.
- [`PytestIntroduction.ipynb`](./PytestIntroduction.ipynb): A Jupyter notebook that introduces how to use **`pytest`** for writing and running tests.
- [`PytestIntroduction_solution.ipynb`](./PytestIntroduction_solution.ipynb): A complete version of the above notebook with **solutions to the exercises**.
- [`my_functions.py`](./my_functions.py): Python module that contains **functions to test**, such as `square`, `divide`, `normalize`, etc. All functions are documented using NumPy-style docstrings.
- [`my_test_file.py`](./my_test_file.py): Test file using **`pytest`**. You can run all tests with:

  ```bash
  pytest my_test_file.py
  ```

This folder is a great starting point for learning **unit testing** and **documentation best practices** in scientific Python development.
